## Instructions to Replace Code

### 1. Update `src/routes/v1/testRoutes.js`

- This file defines the routes for the test module.
- Replace the existing code with the updated route definitions as per your requirements.
- Ensure the route paths and middleware (e.g., `verifyToken`) are correctly configured.

### 2. Update `src/controllers/v1/testController.js`

- This file handles the logic for test-related requests.
- Replace the existing code with the updated controller logic.
- Ensure the controller methods (e.g., `hello`) are properly implemented and handle the required business logic.

### 3. Update `src/services/testService.js`

- This file provides services for the test module.
- Replace the existing code with the updated service logic.
- Ensure the service methods (e.g., `greet`) are implemented to handle the required operations.

### 4. Update `src/requests/v1/testRequest.js`

- This file defines the validation schema for the test module.
- Replace the existing code with the updated validation logic.
- Ensure the validation schema is correctly defined using `Joi` and matches the requirements of the test module.

### 5. Update Route in `src/app.js`

- Ensure the test routes are properly loaded in the application.
- Use the `autoloadRoutes` helper method to dynamically load the test routes.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  import testRoutes from "./routes/v1/testRoutes.js";
  app.use("/api/v1", testRoutes);
  ```

### Notes

- Ensure all dependencies are installed and up-to-date.
- Test the application thoroughly after making the changes to ensure everything works as expected.
